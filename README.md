# redis-client-tdd

This proyect is a training exercise related to a Redis and a TDD courses I finished recently.

The goal is to have some hand-on practice to take the most out of these courses by:

1. Practicing Redis commands
2. Using TDD for designing the library and unit tests
3. Practice with Junit5, AssertJ and Mockito
4. Using Testcontainers to handle the Redis instance for the tests

This library is a wrapper of an existing [redis client project](https://github.com/drm/java-redis-client.git) which [license](./LICENSE) and [documentation](./README_Client.md) are included in this repo.
